# Insurance-Risk-Assesment

The dataset gives an insight into the attributes considered while giving a vehicle insurance.

Problem Statement: An Insurance company wants to asses the risk of their existing customers.

Data Collection: We have got the data from a trusted source where we have previously whipped the data into shape. 

The dataset contains both numerical and categorical variables where we have treated them and tried to find insights from the Bi-Variate 
analysis.

The happy news here is that there are no missing values, hence we need not to impute them.

Feature engineering is done on categorical variables. For unique_values<30 we had done manual encoding and the others(>30) are done with the 
help of LabelEncoder.

Three types of classifiers are fit on the data to check which gives us the best solution.

The model can be used as an AI model to predict the risk associated with the new coming customers.
